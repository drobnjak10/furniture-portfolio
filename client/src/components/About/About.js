        <p>
          As a merchant and independent bottler, our specialization is not to
          produce whisky from its raw ingredients; We leave that to the craft of
          distillers who have been doing so for generations. It is to engage
          with many distillers in Scotland in order to purchase casks of their
          whisky that have matured. It is to take these casks and to create
          unique whiskies under the strong principles of the Alexander Murray
          name. Whether single malt, single cask or blended, you will discover
          quality and innovation in everything we do.
